=== How To Translate BP Registration Groups ===

== Who translates BP Registration Groups? How can I get involved? ==

Anyone can help by suggesting new translations [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/buddypress-registration-groups-1).

Once you've suggested a new translation, a GlotPress validator will review it. They will then approve, reject, or change your suggestions. Once your changes get approved, they are automatically included in the next BP Registration Groups release.

== How does GlotPress work? ==

You can find detailed GlotPress documentation on [this page](https://en.support.wordpress.com/glotpress/).

== I want to change translations locally. Where can I download the .PO file for my language? ==

You'll find options to create a .PO file and export translations at the bottom of each language page in GlotPress.
