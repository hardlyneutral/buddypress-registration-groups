=== How To Translate BP Registration Groups ===

== Who translates BP Registration Groups? How can I get involved? ==

Anyone can help by suggesting new translations [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/buddypress-registration-groups-1).

Once you've suggested a new translation, a GlotPress validator will review it. They will then approve, reject, or change your suggestions. Once your changes get approved, they are automatically shipped to all BP Registration Groups users using WordPress in your language.

== How does GlotPress work? ==

You can find detailed GlotPress documentation on [this page](https://en.support.wordpress.com/glotpress/).

== I want to change translations locally. Where can I download the .PO file for my language? ==

You'll find options to create a .PO file and export translations at the bottom of each language page in GlotPress.
